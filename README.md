A Post-Quantum Cosmos-based Infrustructure (including tendermint consensus and Cosmos-SDK)

Our goal is to replace all the existing signature algorithms of cosmos with post-quantum signature algorithms, so as to create a post-quantum version of CosmosSDK for appchains.

A fully functioning post-quantum CosmosSDK will make it easy for appchain developers to build quantum-resistant blockchains and blockchain applications. This repo aims to create a community to work towards this goal.

We use this repo to keep track of all PRs & tasks. We use bounties to reward developers who complete these tasks.

Below are the steps we will take to achieve this goalï¼š

## Replace the existing signature algorithm in Tendermint/CometBFT

### Replace the existing signature algorithm with Dilithium Signature Algorithm
> This part is based on the `tendermint-pqc` directory which is a fork of the original [tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) repository. Some preliminary tasks have been completed, including a functioning Tendermint core with Dilithium signature algorithm. You can start with this repo and use it 

- [x] Added Dilithium signature algorithm in the crypto package of Tendermint/CometBFT.
- [x] Replaced the existing signature algorithm(Ed25519) with Dilithium in the crypto package of Tendermint/CometBFT.
- [x] Compiled the modified Tendermint and started a network using the Tendermint binary with Dilithium signature algorithm.
- [x] Generated validator keys based on the Dilithium algorithm and blocked successfully.
- [ ] Conduct a thorough code review to identify and fix any potential issues.

### Benchmarking

- [ ] Benchmark the performance of the post-quantum signature algorithms against the existing ones in Tendermint Consensus, including the time cost, space cost, and other performance metrics in consensus.

## Replace the existing signature algorithm in Cosmos-SDK
In this section, the main focus is on modifying the account system of the CosmosSDK, mainly divided into the following parts. We can choose a specific version of the CosmosSDK to implement this part, like `v0.47.15`. This part can be placed in the `cosmos-sdk-pqc` directory.

### Replace the existing signature algorithm with Post-quantum Signature Algorithm

- [ ] Add Dilithium signature algorithm to the CosmosSDK [crypto library](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/crypto).
- [ ] Modify the client's [key management part](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/client/keys) so that the Cosmos-SDK app based on Dilithium signature scheme can generate keys and addresses.
- [ ] Update the signature of the transaction structure and ensure that users can send transactions signed with Dilithium private keys and can be verified by the corresponding Dilithium public keys. Refer to the [auth module](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/auth).
- [ ] Integrate `cosmos-sdk-pqc` and `tendermint-pqc` into `cosmos-app-pqc` which can support developers to start a post-quantum cosmos-based chain, and send transactions based on post-quantum signature to the chain by the cli, including transfers, staking, governance, as well as cosmwasm contract transactions, and so on. Ensure that RPC, Rest API, and gRPC are all available for use.
- [ ] Conduct a thorough code review to identify and fix any potential issues.

### Benchmarking

- [ ] Benchmark the performance of the post-quantum signature algorithms against the existing ones in Cosmos-SDK, including the time cost, space cost, and other performance metrics in the sdk.

## Support keplr wallet

- [ ] Develop a plan to make existing wallet (like keplr) support the post-quantum cosmos-based chain.

## Post-quantum migration

Post-quantum fork has to be done on all CosmosSDK chains that are not quantum resistant - all of them are not quantum resistant now! Come up with a specific and viable plan for post-quantum migration (fork) and submit it to this bounty. Note that the plan needs to be feasible.
