# pqc-cosmos
A Post-Quantum Cosmos-based Infrustructure(include tendermint consensus and Cosmos-SDK)

Our goal is to replace all the existing signature algorithms of cosmos with post-quantum signature algorithms, so as to realize the post-quantum cosmos app.

Below are the steps we will take to achieve this goalï¼š

## Replace the existing signature algorithm in Tendermint/CometBFT

> This part is based on the `tendermint-pqc` directory which is a fork of the original [tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) repository.

- [x] Add Dilithium signature algorithm in the crypto package of Tendermint/CometBFT
- [x] Replace the existing signature algorithm(Ed25519) with Dilithium in the crypto package of Tendermint/CometBFT
- [x] Compile the modified Tendermint and start a network using the Tendermint binary
- [x] Generate validator keys based on the Dilithium algorithm and block successfully.
- [ ] Code review, find possible bugs and fix them.

## Replace the existing signature algorithm in Cosmos-SDK

In this section, the main focus is on modifying the account system of the cosmos sdk, mainly divided into the following parts. We can choose a specific version of the cosmos sdk to implement this part, like `v0.47.15`. This part can be placed in the `cosmos-sdk-pqc` directory.

- [ ] Add the Dilithium algorithm to the existing cosmos sdk [crypto library](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/crypto).
- [ ] Modify the client's [key management part](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/client/keys) so that the Cosmos-SDK app based on Dilithium Algorithm can generate keys and corresponding addresses.
- [ ] Update the signature of the transaction structure and ensure that users can send transactions signed with Dilithium private keys and can be verified by the corresponding Dilithium public keys. Refer to the [auth module](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/auth).
- [ ] Integrate `cosmos-sdk-pqc` and `tendermint-pqc` into `cosmos-app-pqc` which can support developers to start a post-quantum cosmos-based chain, and send transactions based on post-quantum signature to the chain by the cli,including transfers, staking, governance, as well as cosmwasm contract transactions, and so on. Ensure that RPC, Rest API, and gRPC are all available for use.
- [ ] Code review, find possible bugs and fix them.

## Support keplr wallet

- [ ] Make the existing wallet(like keplr) support the post-quantum cosmos-based chain.

## Post-quantum migration

The above implementation is based on a brand new post-quantum cosmos-based chain, so how can we migrate the existing cosmos-based chain to a post-quantum cosmos-based chain? This is what we need to achieve in this part. We hope to achieve post-quantum migration without affecting the existing cosmos-based chain.

- [ ] TBD...
